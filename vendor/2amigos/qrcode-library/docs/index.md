The library provides developers with the tools to generate Qr codes with ease. It is a total refactored version of the 
previous named yii2-qrcode-helper which was based on the ported PHP version of the libqrencode C library.  

This new version is highly inspired by the great work of [BaconQrCode](https://github.com/Bacon/BaconQrCode), in fact, 
it uses a modified version of its code for the writers included on this package.  

## Getting Started

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```
php composer.phar require 2amigos/qrcode-library:~1.1
```
or add

```json
    "2amigos/qrcode-library": "~1.1"
```

### Usage 

The use of the library is quite easy when working as standalone. For example: 

```php
<?php 

use Da\QrCode\QrCode;

$qrCode = (new QrCode('This is my text'))
    ->setSize(250)
    ->setMargin(5)
    ->useForegroundColor(51, 153, 255);

// now we can display the qrcode in many ways
// saving the result to a file:

$qrCode->writeFile(__DIR__ . '/code.png'); // writer defaults to PNG when none is specified

// display directly to the browser 
header('Content-Type: '.$qrCode->getContentType());
echo $qrCode->writeString();

?> 

<?php 
// or even as data:uri url
echo '<img src"' . $qrCode->writeDataUri() . '">';
?>
```

In order to ease the task to write different formats into a QrCode, the library comes with a set of classes. These are: 

- [BookmarkFormat](formats/bookmark.md)
- [BtcFormat](formats/bitcoin.md) 
- [GeoFormat](formats/geo.md)
- [iCalFormat](formats/ical.md)
- [MailMessageFormat](formats/geo.md)
- [MailToFormat](formats/bookmark.md) 
- [MeCardFormat](formats/me-card.md)
- [MmsFormat](formats/mms.md)
- [PhoneFormat](formats/phone.md)
- [SmsFormat](formats/sms.md)
- [vCardFormat](formats/vcard.md)
- [WifiFormat](formats/wifi.md)
- [YoutubeFormat](formats/youtube.md)

Yii2 
----

This library comes also with two special classes to specifically work with the Yii2 framework. These are: 

- [QrCodeComponent](yii/qrcode-component.md)
- [QrCodeAction](yii/qrcode-action.md)
