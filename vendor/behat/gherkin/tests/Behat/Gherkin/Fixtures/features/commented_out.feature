Feature: Fibonacci
  In order to calculate super fast fibonacci series
  As a pythonista
  I want to use Python for that

#
#  Background:
#    Given passing without a table
#
#  Scenario: I'm a multiline name
#            which goes on and on and on for three lines
#            yawn
#    Given passing without a table
#
#  Scenario:
#    Then I should see
#      """
#      a string with #something
#      """
#
#  Scenario Outline: Series
#    When I ask python to calculate fibonacci up to <n>
#    Then it should give me <series>
#
#    Examples:
#      | n   | series                                 |
#      | 1   | []                                     |
#      | 2   | [1, 1]                                 |
#      | 3   | [1, 1, 2]                              |
#      | 4   | [1, 1, 2, 3]                           |
#      | 6   | [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]                        |
#      | 9   | [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]                     |
#      | 100 | [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] |
