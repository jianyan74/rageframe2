## How does Bootstrap's test suite work?

Bootstrap uses [QUnit](https://api.qunitjs.com/), a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit test framework. Each plugin has a file dedicated to its tests in `unit/<plugin-name>.js`.

* `unit/` contains the unit test files for each Bootstrap plugin.
* `vendor/` contains jQuery.
* `visual/` contains "visual" tests which are run interactively in real browsers and require manual verification by humans.

To run our unit tests on a real web browser [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html), run `grunt test-js` or you can 
open `index.html`.


## How do I add a new unit test?

1. Locate and open the file dedicated to the plugin which you need to add tests to (`unit/<plugin-name>.js`).
2. Review the [QUnit API Documentation](https://api.qunitjs.com/) and use the existing tests as references for how to structure your new tests.
3. Write the necessary unit test(s) for the new or revised functionality.
4. Run `grunt test-js` to see the results of your newly-added test(s).

**Note:** Your new unit tests should fail before your changes are applied to the plugin, and should pass after your changes are applied to the plugin.


## What should a unit test look like?

* Each test should have a unique name clearly stating what unit is being tested.
* Each test should test only one unit per test, although one test can include several assertions. Create multiple tests for multiple units of functionality.
* Each test should begin with [`assert.expect`](https://api.qunitjs.com/expect/) to ensure that the expected assertions are run.
* Each test should follow the project's [JavaScript Code Guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#js)

### Example tests

```javascript
// Synchronous test
QUnit.test('should describe the unit being tested', function (assert) {
  assert.expect(1)
  var templateHTML = '<div class="alert alert-danger fade in">'
      + '<a class="close" href="#" data-dismiss="alert">Ã—</a>'
      + '<p><strong>Template necessary for the test.</p>'
      + '</div>'
  var $alert = $(templateHTML).appendTo('#qunit-fixture').bootstrapAlert()

  $alert.find('.close').click()

  // Make assertion
  assert.strictEqual($alert.hasClass('in'), false, 'remove .in class on .close click')
})

// Asynchronous test
QUnit.test('should describe the unit being tested', function (assert) {
  assert.expect(1)
  var done = assert.async()

  $('<div title="tooltip title"></div>')
    .appendTo('#qunit-fixture')
    .on('shown.bs.tooltip', function () {
      assert.ok(true, '"shown" event was fired after calling "show"')
      done()
    })
    .bootstrapTooltip('show')
})
```
