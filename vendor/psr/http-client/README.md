PSR Http Client
===============

This repository holds all interfaces/classes/traits related to
[PSR-18](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/).

Note that this is not an HTTP client implementation of its own. It is merely an
interface that describes an HTTP client. See 
[the specification](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-18-http-client.md)
for more details.

You can find implementations of the specification by looking for packages providing 
the [psr/http-client-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-client-implementation)
virtual package.
